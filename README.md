# sphere_tracing
demo of the sphere tracing algorithm (except in 2d so its technically circle tracing??). When loading in, there will be nothing visible but the 'character' so move your cursor to cast your sphere tracing ray into the scene and uncover the geometry around you. Note that the scene is randomly generated every time you refresh the page so if it isnt seeming to work, its probably because a scene object spawned right ontop of you so just refresh.

demo:
